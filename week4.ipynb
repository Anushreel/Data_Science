    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), 'self' is used as a reference to the instance of a class. It is a convention used in many programming languages.\n",
    "The use of self is essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1]Instance-Specific Data: In OOP, classes define blueprints for creating objects (instances). Each instance of a class can have its own unique data or \n",
    "attributes. By using self, you can access and manipulate these attributes within the methods of the class. This allows you to work with instance-specific\n",
    "data and avoid conflicts between different instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2]Method Invocation: When a method is called on an instance of a class, self ensures that the method operates on the data associated with that particular\n",
    "instance. Without self, it would be ambiguous which instance's data the method should work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3]Encapsulation: self helps enforce the principle of encapsulation, which is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP. \n",
    "Encapsulation means that an object's data (attributes) should be accessed and modified only through its methods, not directly. \n",
    "self ensures that you work with the object's data within its own methods, maintaining encapsulation and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4]Method Chaining: self also enables method chaining, which is a technique where multiple methods can be called on an object in a single line of code. \n",
